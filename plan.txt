Optional Future Ideas:
If service_name is limited to known places (e.g., Passport Office, RTO, Temple), you might later replace it with a ForeignKey to a Place model.

booking_status could evolve into choices (e.g., Pending, Confirmed, Canceled) â€” useful if you want to manage queue workflows later.

Let me know if you want to:

Automatically assign slot_id based on availability

Prevent double-bookings

Add uniqueness constraint (so same user can't double-book the same slot)
